                <p>It’s hard for kids to be without in-person social experience during the pandemic. The question is, is it safe for kids to have playdates? Here we will break down when you might be able to and some of the precautions you should take.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you live somewhere with rising cases of COVID-19 it is probably not currently safe to hold a playdate. However, if your location has a stable, low number of cases it is safer. But don’t click off just yet, there are certain precautions you should still take when having people over.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everybody should wear masks over their nose and mouth</li>
                    <li>Make sure to social distance by at least 6 feet or 3 meters</li>
                    <li>Stay outdoors to keep the likelihood of transmission lower</li>
                    <li>If you have to serve food ideally order out and ask for it in separate bags. Otherwise try to have everyone bring their own food.</li>
                    <li>Wash hands frequently</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Taking these precautions will allow for safer social interactions. Just remember there is no zero risk situation and we have to balance risks and benefits as effectively as we can.</p>
